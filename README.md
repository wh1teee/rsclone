# Canva clone

## Introdution 
  Hello everyone! This is the Canva clone project that we started with my team ([Maria Riazanova](https://github.com/mariariazanova), [Danila Kokhan](https://github.com/kohan123)) on EPAM courses, and I'm currently working on it alone. At the moment it has quite a lot of features: from uploading your own photos, to drawing / inserting various elements, changing the color of the text / background and text, and much more.
At the moment, you can only choose a resume!

To work with the application, you need to register! If you do not want to register, you can use this data to log in: email: test@test.io, password: test777 

Then click "create design", or select the slide " Resume"
